# PersonalAI

This is a passion project, and there are so many resources becoming available. Oogabooga, multiple versions of LLMs based off of Llama or even newly created models available in GPT4All... the speed of change can be dizzying. I'm currently running (very slowly) the Wizard 13B model within GPT4ALL. It works, but does not have the functionality I am looking for. So the desire to code my own.

This repo contains information and code used to install and run an LLM on my local PC - at least the specific parts of projects I use and portions I create. I am forking some repositories I am using, and . The original repos I use/modify will be linked here in the readme, however this repo will only contain the specific parts of each repo I am using. What I am aiming for is a streamlined collection of code specific not only to my objectives, but also the limitations of the hardware in my PC (specs below).  

Future plans include adding training with my own data, adding offline voice commands/prompting and an avatar that provides the results through text to speech.
