Information and code used to install and run Llama on my local PC

This is something I've wanted to be able to do for a long time. This project repo will detail what software was used and how it works. 

I decided to not fork the different repositories I am using. The original repos will be linked here in the readme, however this repo will only contain the specific parts of each repo I am using. What I am aiming for is a streamlined collection of code specific not only to my objectives, but also the limitations of the hardware in my PC (specs below).  

Future plans include adding training with my own data, adding offline voice commands/prompting and an avatar that provides the results through text to speech.
