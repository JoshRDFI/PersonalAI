Information covering installing and running Llama on my local PC

This is something I've wanted to be able to do for a long time. This project page will detail what software was used and how it works. 

Future plans include adding training with my own data, adding offline voice commands/prompting and an avatar that provides the results through text to speech. 

More to follow soon!
